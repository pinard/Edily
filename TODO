* Ideas for `joue'

.* Add comment boxes to all functions.

.* I wonder if zero_timeval should not be better computed at the time of the
   first soundful event.  There might be a lot of MIDI communication setup at
   the beginning of a MIDI file, possibly causing some ugly catchup right at
   the start of the performance.

.* After a SIGCONT, zero_timeval should be reset to the current time, so it is
   possible to suspend playback without later catchup.

.* Add a fake track for bars, and report them as we go on.

.* An option to produce track timing only.

.* An option to produce a merged format 0 from format 1.

.* An option to merge many format 0 and format 1 inputs into a single type 1,
   with control over tracks and channels.

.* Compute an annotated bar and track matrix, with catchup code at each bar.

.* Make it interactive to play selected bars and tracks.  Think `fdesign'.
